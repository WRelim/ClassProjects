# Class Projects
## William Seegmiller- Southwest Technical College
### This contains my projects that were created for end of class projects.

"RockPaperProject" is my first project for school where I was required to use an array. It is a "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" game.

"PlannerFinal" is my second project where I was required to use an Object class. 
It's a planner with ADHD accessibilty in mind. It reminds you of tasks you have assigned to a day of the week to complete.
